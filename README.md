## Project Documentation

### For Software:

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![Front / Landing](images/img1.png)
This is the front or starting page of the site.

![Alert & Recording](images/img2.png)
When the code is typed alert is sent and voice starts getting recorded.

![Alert Sent](images/img3.png)
The alert is sent to the person's saved contact.

#### Diagrams
The UI is like a simple calculator and can do simple maths. But when the secret code is typed is a alert message is immediately sent into the saved contacts and starts recording , also the location is also sent to the saved person.the architecture flow is easy the frontend is develeped by javascript ,  css , html wheras the backend ia by react.bith of the are intergrated by index.html file in the frontend folder. the only api used is for connecting whatsapp api. where as most of the files are imported from file to file for smooth work flow.

api is used is  whatsapp for interconnecting whatsapp
```

**Available Commands:**
-npm run dev - to run frontend
-server node.js - to run backend
- 

**Options:**
- `-h, --help` - Show help message and exit
- `-v, --verbose` - Enable verbose output
- `-o, --output FILE` - Specify output file path
- `-c, --config FILE` - Specify configuration file
- `--version` - Show version information

**Examples:**

```bash
# Example 1: Basic usage
python script.py input.txt

# Example 2: With verbose output
python script.py -v input.txt

# Example 3: Specify output file
python script.py -o output.txt input.txt

# Example 4: Using configuration
python script.py -c config.json --verbose input.txt
```

#### Demo Output

**Example 1: Basic Processing**

**Input:**
```
This is a sample input file
with multiple lines of text
for demonstration purposes
```

**Command:**
```bash
python script.py sample.txt
```

**Output:**

{
  "name": "test",
  "value": 123
}
```

**Command:**
```bash
python script.py -v --format json data.json
```

**Output:**
```
[VERBOSE] Loading configuration...

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
